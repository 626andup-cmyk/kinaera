/**
 * RNG friend creation: "Surprise me" in Settings writes a new friend for
 * you, from a few random ingredients, so it's someone you wouldn't have
 * thought of.
 *
 * Asking a model for "a random character" gets the same few every time, so
 * the randomness comes from here: a temperament, a way of talking, two
 * interests, a quirk, and what they love in a story, each picked at random
 * from lists below (`rollSeeds`). The model (the profile that writes OOC)
 * turns them into a name and a "who your friend is" prompt, written the way
 * the default one is. Nothing is saved until you press Save in Settings;
 * roll again as often as you like.
