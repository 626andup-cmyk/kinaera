/**
 * The notebook keeper: notices what the story establishes, and writes it
 * into the notebook, as your friend, between turns.
 *
 * A character gets a name, a place turns out to be haunted, Ilse admits she
 * had a brother. Those are lasting facts, and the notebook is where they
 * belong, so neither of you has to stop and write them down. But a keeper
 * that writes down wrong things is worse than none, so every step is
 * checked, and unsure always means "leave the notebook alone":
 *
 *   1. **Is there anything?** Every few posts in a roleplay channel
 *      (`keeperEvery`, or when a scene ends), Jev reads the new posts and the
 *      notebook's names and is asked, each in two phrasings that must agree
 *      (a series, see src/jev.ts): is there a new named character, place or
 *      thing that will matter? Is there a lasting fact about something
 *      already in the notebook? Does the story contradict something the
 *      notes say (Kitsikai's "does this take back the note?")? Usually the
 *      answer is no, and that's one cheap call.
 *   2. **What exactly?** Only on a yes, a writer model (the profile that
 *      writes summaries) drafts the changes as JSON: new entries, and notes
 *      to add to existing ones, each with a one-sentence claim of what the
 *      story established.
 *   3. **Is it really in the text?** Jev checks every claim against the
 *      posts alone, again in two or three phrasings that must all agree.
 *      Anything not confidently supported is dropped.
 *   4. **Made as your friend.** New entries are shared ("joint"). Notes and
 *      corrections go through the notebook's permissions like any of your
 *      friend's edits (locked entries are left alone), except that your own
 *      entries only ever get suggestions: nothing of yours changes unless
 *      you say so. What was done shows in the channel ("⚙ Arlo added Tamsin to
 *      the notebook") and in your friend's recent actions.
 *
 * ## Nothing hidden leaks
 *
 * Like summaries, the keeper works from the messages, which you can read,
 * and only shows the writer entries that aren't hidden from you. Claims are
 * checked against the messages alone. So nothing from a secret entry can
 * end up in a shared one.
 *
 * It only reads roleplay channels: in OOC you're talking *about* the story,
 * and ideas there aren't canon yet. It reads each post once (edits to old
 * posts don't set it off again).
