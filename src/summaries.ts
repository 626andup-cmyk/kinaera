/**
 * Summaries (stage 7): how long stories fit in the context.
 *
 * A model can only read so much at once, so a prompt holds only the most
 * recent messages (`historyLimit`). Everything older is remembered through
 * summaries, layered so the context stays small without losing the thread:
 *
 *   messages ──> scene summaries ──> the story so far ──> the digest
 *        └────> "earlier in this scene"                        │
 *                                                              v
 *                                                        OOC's overview
 *
 * - **Scene summaries** are written when a scene ends (at each scene
 *   break): what happened in it, and how it ended.
 * - **The story so far** is updated from each new scene summary, folding it
 *   into what was there: updated incrementally, never rewritten from
 *   scratch (unless you ask, or something it covers changed).
 * - **Earlier in this scene** covers a long scene that's still going (in OOC
 *   channels, which have no scenes, the whole conversation). Once more than
 *   `historyLimit + summaryEvery` of its messages are waiting, the oldest
 *   ones are folded into it, leaving `historyLimit` in full. Until then
 *   they're all sent in full, so a message is always either in the prompt
 *   or in a summary, never lost in between.
 * - **The digest** is one or two lines per channel (who's in it, where the
 *   story stands, its emotional temperature). OOC channels read every
 *   channel's digest, and the fuller summary of a channel that comes up.
 *
 * **Nothing hidden from you ever reaches a summary.** Summaries are written
 * only from the messages themselves (which you can all read), never from
 * the notebook, where secrets live. And you can read, edit or regenerate
 * every summary in the app.
 *
 * This file stores summaries and decides what's covered; src/summarizer.ts
 * asks the model to write them.
