/**
 * Bringing a stage 1 chat into the stage 2 database.
 *
 * Stage 1 saved everything to `data/chat.json`: one chat, its settings, and
 * one character sheet. The first time stage 2 starts, if that file exists,
 * its contents are copied into the new database:
 *
 *   - the settings become the server settings
 *   - the chat becomes the `#story` channel, and its character sheet becomes
 *     a notebook entry of your friend's, pinned to it
 *   - an empty `#ooc` channel is added
 *
 * The old file is then renamed to `chat.json.imported`. It isn't deleted, so
 * nothing is lost if anything looks wrong; once you're happy, you can delete
 * it yourself.
