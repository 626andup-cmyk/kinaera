/**
 * Jev double-checks: the places Kinaera used to guess, and now asks.
 *
 * Kinaera makes a handful of small judgements outside the writing itself.
 * Most are plain rules and should stay that way (see docs/jev-audit.md for
 * every one, and why). These are the ones where a wrong guess costs
 * something, and a Jev **series** (one question in two phrasings that must
 * agree, see src/jev.ts) does better:
 *
 *   - **Comment replies** (`wantsReply`): your friend always answers
 *     comments on their own messages, or in threads they're in. A comment on
 *     *your* message used to get no answer, even "Arlo, is this too much?".
 *     Now Jev is asked whether it invites a reply.
 *   - **Deleting an entry** (`confirmDelete`): the one thing your friend can
 *     do that can't be undone. Before it happens, Jev is asked whether it's
 *     clearly wanted. If not confidently yes, it's held back, and your
 *     friend is told why.
 *   - **Faithful summaries** (`faithfulSummary`): scene summaries feed the
 *     story so far, the digests and every prompt after, so one invented
 *     detail spreads. Each new scene summary is checked against the scene;
 *     a confident "no" gets it rewritten once, more strictly.
 *   - **Channel mentions** (`aboutChannels`): in OOC, a channel's summary is
 *     added when it comes up. `#story` is clear; the bare word "story" often
 *     isn't about the channel. Bare-word matches are checked, and a
 *     confident no leaves the summary out.
 *
 * Every check needs Jev (or its fallback) and the "Double-check with Jev"
 * setting (`jevChecks`). Without them, things work as before. A check that
 * fails (Jev down) falls back the same way, except deleting, which waits.
