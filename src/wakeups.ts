/**
 * Wake-ups (stage 8): your friend taking a turn without a message from you.
 *
 * The design's core rule is that *a friend turn never requires a user
 * message*, and stage 8 is where that pays off. Your friend gets a turn
 * when something happens:
 *
 *   - **you open the app** ("away" if you haven't written for a while,
 *     `awayHours`; otherwise just "opened")
 *   - **a scene ends** (one you ended, once it's been summarized)
 *   - **a suggestion of yours is waiting for their review**
 *   - (endgame) **the heartbeat**, a timer: see src/heartbeat.ts
 *
 * A wake-up is a turn in your OOC channel (the one you talked in last),
 * with tools if the profile has them. Its prompt says why they're up, how
 * long it's been since you last wrote, what's waiting, and the summary of
 * a scene that just ended; OOC's prompt already has the server digest. They
 * can write, act with tools, or do nothing (`do_nothing`, or replying
 * `[nothing]` without tools), which is usually right.
 *
 * ## Rules that aren't up to anyone
 *
 * - **Chattiness** (`Settings.wakeups`) decides which events count at all:
 *   off; quiet (coming back after being away, and reviews); normal (also a
 *   scene ending); chatty (also any time you open the app).
 * - **Quiet hours**: never, except reviews (which are silent work).
 * - **A cooldown** between wake-ups (`wakeCooldownMinutes`, reviews 10).
 * - **Never twice in a row**: once your friend has reached out, they wait
 *   for you to write before reaching out again (reviews excepted).
 * - Not while they're writing in that channel, and not without an API key.
 *
 * ## Jev decides whether it's the moment
 *
 * Before a writer model is even called, Jev (src/jev.ts) is asked, with a
 * snapshot of what's going on: "the user just came back after 2 days: would
 * a short message feel natural and welcome right now?" A confident yes
 * wakes your friend; no, or unsure, doesn't (the safe path). Reviews skip
 * the question: they're work, not conversation. With Jev turned off (and no
 * fallback profile), your friend's own turn decides, through do_nothing.
 *
 * Every wake-up that got as far as Jev is in the wake-up log (Settings →
 * Your friend reaching out), with what came of it and why.
