/**
 * The heartbeat: your friend reaching out out of nowhere, the way a person
 * texts "wait, I just had an idea". An endgame feature from DESIGN.md.
 *
 * Every `heartbeatHours` (each gap varies by ±20%, so it never feels like
 * clockwork), the server checks in on its own, even with the app closed:
 *
 *   1. **The rules first** (`Wakeups.blocked`): chattiness, quiet hours, the
 *      cooldown, never twice unanswered, not mid-conversation. Most beats
 *      stop here, costing nothing.
 *   2. **Generate**: your friend (the profile that writes OOC) comes up
 *      with a few ideas: a new story, a character, a twist for a story
 *      you're in, or a thought about something you talked about. They see
 *      the server digest, the recent OOC chat, the notebook's names, and
 *      ideas they've had before, so they don't repeat themselves.
 *   3. **Grade**: Jev grades each idea, in a series of three questions that
 *      must all agree: is it fresh (not already done or talked about, the
 *      way Kitsikai checks a reminder isn't redundant)? Would the user be
 *      excited by it? Is it worth texting about, not generic? Confident
 *      yes: exciting. Confident no: dropped. Unsure: into the drawer.
 *   4. **Share the best**: the best exciting idea becomes a wake-up
 *      ("heartbeat"), with the idea in the prompt, and Jev's usual "is it
 *      the moment?" before it. If it isn't shared, it goes in the drawer.
 *
 * With no exciting idea, and a long enough silence (at least
 * `heartbeatHours`), your friend may still check in "just because", with
 * the best ideas from the drawer to bring up if they fit.
 *
 * **The idea drawer** (src/ideas.ts) is also offered on other wake-ups
 * (coming back, a scene ending). After a wake-up message, Jev is asked
 * which of them it actually brought up, and those are marked shared.
 *
 * A message on a heartbeat (or any wake-up) sends a phone notification
 * when the app isn't on screen (src/notify.ts).
